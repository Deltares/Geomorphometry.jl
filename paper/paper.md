# Summary
<!-- A summary describing the high-level functionality and purpose of the software for a diverse, non-specialist audience. -->

Geomorphometry.jl is a Julia package for analyzing and visualizing terrain properties such as slope, aspect, curvature, and other land-surface parameters. It includes hydrological features, such as flow accumulation, and filters. By leveraging efficient Julia functions and data structures, it helps researchers explore how geological features evolve.
