  abstract      = {Depressions (or pits) are low areas within a digital elevation model that are surrounded by higher terrain, with no outlet to lower areas. Filling them so they are level, as fluid would fill them if the terrain were impermeable, is often necessary in preprocessing DEMs. The depression-filling algorithm presented here---called Priority-Flood---unifies and improves on the work of a number of previous authors who have published similar algorithms. The algorithm operates by flooding DEMs inwards from their edges using a priority queue to determine the next cell to be flooded. The resultant DEM has no depressions or digital dams: every cell is guaranteed to drain. The algorithm is optimal for both integer and floating-point data, working in O(n) and O(n lg n) time, respectively. It is shown that by using a plain queue to fill depressions once they have been found, an O(m lg m) time-complexity can be achieved, where m does not exceed the number of cells n. This is the lowest time complexity of any known floating-point depression-filling algorithm. In testing, this improved variation of the algorithm performed up to 37\% faster than the original. Additionally, a parallel version of an older, but widely-used depression-filling algorithm required six parallel processors to achieve a run-time on par with what the newer algorithm's improved variation took on a single processor. The Priority-Flood Algorithm is simple to understand and implement: the included pseudocode is only 20 lines and the included C++ reference implementation is under a hundred lines. The algorithm can work on irregular meshes as well as 4-, 6-, 8-, and n-connected grids. It can also be adapted to label watersheds and determine flow directions through either incremental elevation changes or depression carving. In the case of incremental elevation changes, the algorithm includes safety checks not present in prior works.},

  abstract    = {Geographical data are used in so many aspects of our lives today, ranging from disaster relief operations through to finding directions on our mobile phones. We can all be data collectors, adding locational information as we capture digitally our day-to-day experiences. Geographical Information Systems (GIS) are the software tools that facilitate this, turning the raw data into useful information that can help us understand our worlds better. Principles of Geographical Information Systems presents a thorough overview of the subject, exploring both the theoretical basis of GIS, and their use in practice. It explains how data on the world are converted into digital form and the analytical capabilities used to bring understanding to a range of areas of interest and issues. Spatial data are usually based on two, dichotomous paradigms: exactly defined entities in space, such as land parcels and urban structures, or the continuous variation of single attributes, such as temperature or rainfall. The adoption of one or the other influences how the geographical data are structured in the GIS and the types of analysis possible. A further area of focus in the book concerns the problems of data quality and how statistical errors in spatial data can affect the results of spatial modelling based on the two paradigms of space. Fuzzy logic and continuous classification methods are presented as methods for linking the two spatial paradigms. The book concludes with an overview of current developments and trends in providing spatial data to an ever-expanding global community of users.

  abstract   = {Digital terrain models (DTMs) are datasets containing altitude values above or below a reference level, such as a reference ellipsoid or a tidal datum over geographic space, often in the form of a regularly gridded raster. They can be used to calculate terrain attributes that describe the shape and characteristics of topographic surfaces. Calculating these terrain attributes often requires multiple software packages that can be expensive and specialized. We have created a free, open-source R package, MultiscaleDTM, that allows for the calculation of members from each of the five major thematic groups of terrain attributes: slope, aspect, curvature, relative position, and roughness, from a regularly gridded DTM. Furthermore, these attributes can be calculated at multiple spatial scales of analysis, a key feature that is missing from many other packages. Here, we demonstrate the functionality of the package and provide a simulation exploring the relationship between slope and roughness. When roughness measures do not account for slope, these attributes exhibit a strong positive correlation. To minimize this correlation, we propose a new roughness measure called adjusted standard deviation. In most scenarios tested, this measure produced the lowest rank correlation with slope out of all the roughness measures tested. Lastly, the simulation shows that some existing roughness measures from the literature that are supposed to be independent of slope can actually exhibit a strong inverse relationship with the slope in some cases.},

This technology is becoming a primary method for generating high-resolution digital terrain models (DTMs) that are essential to numerous applications such as flood modeling and landslide prediction. Airborne LIDAR systems usually return a three-dimensional cloud of point measurements from reflective objects scanned by the laser beneath the flight path. In order to generate a DTM, measurements from nonground features such as buildings, vehicles, and vegetation have to be classified and removed. In this paper, a progressive morphological filter was developed to detect nonground LIDAR measurements. By gradually increasing the window size of the filter and using elevation difference thresholds, the measurements of vehicles, vegetation, and buildings are removed, while ground data are preserved. Datasets from mountainous and flat urbanized areas were selected to test the progressive morphological filter. The results show that the filter can remove most of the nonground points effectively.},

  abstract = {Current use of land surface curvatures (LSCs) is in a confused state as a large gap has opened up between applications and theoretical work. LSCs exercise important control on changes of gravity potential energy and the equilibrium of the surface, and they are increasingly used in geosciences but they are not consistently defined. This paper offers a comprehensive theoretical framework for definition, classification and interpretation of LSCs. Systematization of known and newly derived relationships between LSCs is followed by extension of the traditional scheme for interpretation. A new comprehensive system of LSCs starts with the basic trio: profile, plan and twisting curvatures, and includes their slope-dependent sub-forms, combinations and imitations. Analysis of their influence on changes of gravitational potential energy available for mass flows is crucial for their understanding, and leads to a new interpretation of difference curvature. The systematic evaluation of LSCs as expressions of slope disequilibrium offers a further interpretation: zero values of LSCs can be considered as important theoretical attractors of landform development. LSCs are increasingly employed for analyses of landslide, flood, snow avalanche, forest fire, soil erosion, mass balance, ground water, digital soil mapping, individual landform identification and land surface segmentation, modelling of landscape development, classification of LIDAR data and visualization of terrain features. Important improvement of LSC use in all these spheres is possible. They are mostly computed in geographical information systems with limited capabilities: the performance of ArcGIS, SAGA, GRASS, LandSerf, Surfer and MICRODEM is compared here. The important interrelations of DEM resolution, accuracy and generalization are demonstrated in relation to the nested hierarchy of land forms and processes. The best interpretable LSCs, and challenges of future progress, are specified at the close of the paper.},

The Simple Morphological Filter (SMRF) addresses this problem by applying image processing techniques to the data. This implementation uses a linearly increasing window and simple slope thresholding, along with a novel application of image inpainting techniques. When tested against the ISPRS LIDAR reference dataset, SMRF achieved a mean 85.4\% Kappa score when using a single parameter set and 90.02\% when optimized. SMRF is intended to serve as a stable base from which more advanced progressive filters can be designed. This approach is particularly effective at minimizing Type I error rates, while maintaining acceptable Type II error rates. As a result, the final surface preserves subtle surface variation in the form of tracks and trails that make this approach ideally suited for the production of DEMs used as ground surfaces in immersive virtual environments.},

Upslope area is then calculated by proportioning flow between two downslope pixels according to how close this flow direction is to the direct angle to the downslope pixel. This procedure offers improvements over prior procedures that have restricted flow to eight possible directions (introducing grid bia) or proportioned flow according to slope (introducing unrealistic dispersion). The new procedure is more robust than prior procedures based on fitting local planes while retaining a simple grid based structure.

The main advantages of the algorithm are threshold-freedom and independence from LIDAR data format and resolution, while preserving object and terrain details. The framework for Skewness Balancing has been built in this contribution with a prediction model in which unknown LIDAR tiles can be categorised as ``hilly'' or ``moderate'' terrains. Accuracy assessment of the model is carried out using cross-validation with an overall accuracy of 95\%. An extension to the algorithm is developed to address the overclassification issue for hilly terrain. For moderate terrain, the results show that from the classified tiles detached objects (buildings and vegetation) and attached objects (bridges and motorway junctions) are separated from bare earth (ground, roads and yards) which makes Skewness Balancing ideal to be integrated into geographic information system (GIS) software packages.},

We show that large errors in the computed contributing areas result for any terrain topography: divergent, convergent, or planar. We present a new model, called digital elevation model networks (DEMON), which avoids the above problems by representing flow in two dimensions and directed by aspect. DEMON allows computation of both contributing and dispersal areas. DEMON offers the main advantage of contour-based models (e.g., Moore et al., 1988), the representation of varying flow width over nonplanar topography, while having the convenience of using rectangular grid DEMs.},
